This case study is the Capstone Project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.

## About the Company

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused smart products targeted at women. They have been gaining popularity as a tech-driven wellness company and aims to further its success by seeking new opportunities for growth.

## Business Task

Bellabeat plans to analyse data on how non-Bellabeat users utilise their existing smart devices, specifically FitBit Fitness Tracker users. The insights identified will aid in informing and enhancing Bellabeat's marketing strategy for one of its products: **the Bellabeat application**.

## Analysis Questions

1.  What are some trends in smart device usage?
2.  How could these trends apply to Bellabeat's customers?
3.  How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

## About the Dataset

The FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, made available by Mobius (CC0: Public Domain), on Kaggle was examined in the present analysis. This dataset was collected from a survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk from 03.12.2016 to 05.12.2016 and includes data from thirty Fitbit users who consented to share minute-level information on personal tracker data - physical activity, heart rate and sleep monitoring.

## Data Credibility

The dataset is referenced but no longer up-to-date, with its last update occurring three years ago. The data is not original as it has been pre-processed and the dataset has limitations such as a relatively small sample size and lack of demographic information.

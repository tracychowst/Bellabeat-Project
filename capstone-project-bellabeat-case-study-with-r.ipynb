They have been gaining popularity as a tech-driven wellness company and aims to further its success by seeking new opportunities for growth.\n\n# 1. Ask Phase\n\n**Business Task**\n\nBellabeat plans to analyse data on how non-Bellabeat users utilise their existing smart devices, specifically FitBit Fitness Tracker users. The insights identified will aid in informing and enhancing Bellabeat's marketing strategy for one of its products: **the Bellabeat application**.\n\n**Analysis Questions**\n\n1.  What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2.  How could these trends apply to Bellabeat's customers?\n3.  How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?\n\n# 2. Prepare Phase\n\n**About the Dataset**\n\nThe FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, made available by Mobius (CC0: Public Domain), on Kaggle was examined in the present analysis. This dataset was collected from a survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk from 03.12.2016 to 05.12.2016 and includes data from thirty Fitbit users who consented to share minute-level information on personal tracker data - physical activity, heart rate and sleep monitoring.\n\n**Data Credibility**\n\nThe dataset is referenced but no longer up-to-date, with its last update occurring three years ago. The data is not original as it has been pre-processed and the dataset has limitations such as a relatively small sample size and lack of demographic information.\n\n# 3. Process Phase\n\n## 3.1.

Analyse Phase\n\nMain Question: What are some trends in smart device usage that can help shape the marketing strategy for other smart devices?\n\n## 4.1. Preliminary Analysis\n\nLet's first examine the activity levels of the users before exploring the summary statistics of the daily and hourly datasets.\n\n### Activity Level of Users\n\nQuestion: What is the distribution of activity levels among users?\n\nActivity level here refers to the daily step count of an individual. According to the graduated step index, proposed by [Tudor-Locke and Bassett (2004)](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-8-79#), step count can be grouped into 5 categories:\n\n-   sedentary: <5,000 steps per day\n\n-   low active: 5,000 to 7,499 steps per day\n\n-   somewhat active: 7,500 to 9,999 steps per day\n\n-   active: ≥10,000 to 12,499 steps per day\n\n-   highly active: ≥12,500 steps per day\n\nGiven the relatively small sample size of 33 users, it may not be feasible to categorise the sample into more representative activity level groups - individuals with the same activity levels - as this could result in very small sample sizes within each group. Assessing the activity levels of users within the present sample can help to determine whether the number of participants for each activity level is evenly distributed or skewed. An even distribution would allow for a more accurate representation of the sample without the need to further divide the sample into smaller groups.\n\nTherefore, taking this approach helps to ensure that any findings from the data analysis would reflect the average results across the different activity levels.\n\nThe present analysis will focus on four categories from the graduated step index to determine the distribution of activity levels: sedentary, low active, somewhat active and active.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a data frame to summarise activity level of each user\navg_steps <- daily_activity %>% \n  group_by(id) %>% \n  summarise(mean_steps = mean(total_steps), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  mutate(active_level = case_when(\n    mean_steps < 5000 ~ \"sedentary\",\n    mean_steps >= 5000 & mean_steps < 7500 ~ \"low active\",\n    mean_steps >= 7500 & mean_steps < 10000 ~ \"somewhat active\",\n    mean_steps >= 10000 ~ \"active\"))\nhead(avg_steps)\n\n# Calculating activity level distribution percentage\navg_steps_active <- avg_steps %>% \n  group_by(active_level) %>% \n  summarise(total_active = n()) %>% \n  mutate(percent_active = round(total_active/sum(total_active),2),\n         percentage = scales::percent(percent_active))\nhead(avg_steps_active)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-21T09:39:54.611950Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-21T09:39:54.613973Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-21T09:39:54.707682Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Representing the 4 categories in a pie chart\nggplot(avg_steps_active, aes(x=\"\", y= percent_active, fill=active_level)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = percentage), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start=0) + \n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Activity Level Distribution\", fill = \"activity level\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12), legend.title = element_text(size = 10)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"sedentary\"=\"#f2bd90\", \"low active\"=\"#efd77e\",\"somewhat active\"=\"#b6cb81\", \"active\" = \"#6ebc9e\"), \n                    limits = c(\"active\", \"somewhat active\", \"low active\", \"sedentary\"),\n                    labels = c(\"active: ≥10,000 steps per day\",\n                               \"somewhat active: 7,500 to 9,999 steps per day\",\n                               \"low active: 5,000 to 7,499 steps per day\",\n                               \"sedentary: <5,000 steps per day\"))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-21T17:15:16.226268Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-21T17:15:16.227839Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-21T17:15:16.578662Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The pie chart illustrates that the number of participants in each activity level is nearly evenly distributed.\n\nBased on this finding, it is reasonable to assume that the current sample is a reliable reflection of the average outcomes among the different activity levels.

Share Phase\n## Conclusion\nWith the goal of empowering women by providing insights into their health and lifestyle habits, Bellabeat aims to examine trends in non-Bellabeat smart devices to inform its own marketing strategies to further inspire women around the world.\n\nIn the present analysis, several insights have been uncovered that may aid in shaping Bellabeat’s marketing strategy for the Bellabeat app. \n\nDespite these findings, to obtain a more reliable understanding of its users, Bellabeat should aim to examine its own data in future analyses. This recommendation is owed to the small sample size, constrained analyses and lack of demographic information in the current sample, which may potentially introduce biases and result in inaccurate insights. For instance, while Bellabeat's target audience is mainly women, it is important to acknowledge that the sample used in this analysis is assumed to include both men and women.\n\n## Recommendations\n### 1. Reminder notifications and informative articles\n#### Step count\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study found that walking 8000 steps daily reduced the risk of mortality by 51% compared to walking 4000 steps, while walking 12000 steps lowered the risk by 65%. This suggests that increasing daily step count to a minimum of 8000 steps may potentially be beneficial to overall health. In the present analysis, users averaged 7638 steps per day, which is slightly below the proposed 8000 steps. \n\n*Recommendation*: The Bellabeat application could introduce articles to educate users on the benefits of walking to overall health and implement notifications to remind users to achieve a daily step target of 8000 steps. Users could also be given the option to set personalised step challenges, allowing them to increase their daily step targets according to their own capabilities and preferences.\n\nGiven that the peak hourly step counts and intensity levels tend to occur between 5 pm and 8 pm on weekdays and between 12 pm to 3 pm on Saturdays, the Bellabeat application could send users reminders to engage in physical activity during these time frames.\n\n#### Active minutes \nIt was also observed that the sample exceeded the recommended combined range of very active and fairly active minutes. Nevertheless, users can be encouraged to maintain these enhanced health benefits by continuing their current habits.\n\n*Recommendation*: Articles could be introduced to educate users on the benefits of reaching or exceeding the recommended range of weekly very active and/or fairly active minutes and users could be given the flexibility to set customisable daily and weekly active minutes targets according to their own capabilities and daily schedules. Additionally, reminder notifications can be incorporated to motivate users to reach their targets.  \n\n#### Sleep duration\nAlthough the recommended daily sleep duration is between 7 and 9 hours, users in the sample typically sleep around 7 hours, which falls at the lower end of the range. \n\n*Recommendation*: Users would be able to customize their sleep schedules within the Bellabeat application by specifying their preferred sleep and wake times. If the selected timeframe does not align with the recommended 7 to 9 hours of sleep, users will be alerted. Additionally, users can set notifications to remind them that their sleep schedule is approaching, prompting them to prepare for bedtime.\n\n#### Inconsistent use\nThe daily and hourly activity datasets have more participants than the daily sleep dataset. This discrepancy could perhaps be due to users wearing their smart devices during the day to track their daily activities, but not at night to track their sleep.\n\n*Recommendation*: The Bellabeat application could provide articles aimed at educating users on the benefits of adequate sleep and inform users that tracking their sleep and daily activities may allow them to obtain a more holistic understanding of their health and lifestyle habits. The application could also encourage users to track both daily activities and sleep by sending reminder notifications to wear their devices when not in use.\n\n### 2. Support networks, challenges and rewards\nRecommendation: Support networks, challenges and rewards can be included in the Bellabeat application. Users can invite friends and join communities to form support networks to make their fitness journey enjoyable and interactive. Within these networks, users would be able to motivate each other to achieve their personal goals, share their progress and experiences, and set shared fitness goals. Furthermore, Bellabeat can organise challenges for users, encouraging them to accomplish specific fitness goals. Users who successfully complete these challenges will earn badges or rewards, which serve as incentives to encourage users to take part in the challenges.  \n\nBy including these social and incentivising elements into the fitness experience, the Bellabeat application can create a supportive and engaging platform for users to improve their health.
